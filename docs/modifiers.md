## The two main keys

### It starts with the Mega key

- Mega is a pseudo-key; there is no physical "Mega" key
- "Mega" represents pressing all three modifier keys at the same time (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Opt</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>)
- This combination is relatively easy. Both to recall and press.
- The name "Mega" was chosen because some related conventions call this combination "Meh" ("Meh"-ga)
- ⁂ is the symbol for Mega. It represents the three keys that are pressed. 
- Software can be used to repurpose the <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> key into a physical <kbd>Mega</kbd> key.

             Opt removed                
```
*The 4 variations of Mega differ by a single modifier key*

### Giga is the bigger variant

- Giga is another pseudo-key: Shift+Mega (<kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Opt</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>)
- Giga is the shifted version of Mega. (Think SI prefixes)
- ❖ is the symbol for Mega. It represents the four keys that are pressed. 
- Software can be used to repurpose the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key into a physical <kbd>Giga</kbd>
- Giga can also be accessed via <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>CapsLock</kbd> if CapsLock has been configured as the Mega key.

## The three additional "anti" keys

- There are three "anti" keys.
- The anti keys are variations of Mega with one key removed.
- Unlike Mega/Giga, the anti keys have shifted versions (that don't have special names on their own)
  - For example both `Wish` and `Shift-Wish` are unique. While `Shift-Mega` is just `Giga` and `Shift-Giga` doesn't make sense.

### Chaos

- Chaos is the "Anti-ctrl" pseudo-key: Mega minus Ctrl (<kbd>Opt</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>)
- ❋ is the symbol for Chaos.
- Software can be used to repurpose <kbd>Right Ctrl</kbd> for <kbd>Chaos</kbd>
- Mnemonics
  - "Chaos" implies "uncontrolled."
  - ❋ symbol is similar to the [Chaos Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_of_Chaos)

### Force

- Force is the "Anti-opt" pseudo-key: Mega minus Opt (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>)
- ▲ is the symbol for Force.
- Software can be used to repurpose <kbd>Right Option</kbd> for <kbd>Force</kbd>
- Mnemonics
  - To "force" is to leave no "option."
  - Triforce (▲ resembles artifact from [Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforce))

### Wish

- Wish is the "Anti-cmd" pseudo-key: Mega minus Cmd (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Opt</kbd>)
- ⭑ is the symbol for Wish.
- Software can be used to repurpose <kbd>Right Cmd</kbd> for <kbd>Wish</kbd>
- Mnemonics
  - "Your wish is my command"
  - "Wish" is a less agressive form of "command"
  - "Wish upon a star" (for the ⭑ symbol)

## Windows/Linux versions

- While Mega/Giga/Chaos work across platforms, some keys are slightly MacOS-centric.
- For the remaining two keys, words that play with the Linux key names may be used
  - "Main" vs "Alt" ("Alternate")
  - "Sub" vs "Super" ([Win] key on some Linux distros)
- Used either prepended (`Main.Wish-C`) or by itself (`Main-C`)
- The symbols remain unchanged.
